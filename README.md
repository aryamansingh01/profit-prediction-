# profit-prediction-
A company should always set a goal that should be achievable, otherwise, employees will not be able to work to their best potential if they find that the goal set by company is unachievable.  The profit earned by a company for a particular period depends on several factors like how much time and money spend on R&amp;D marketing and many more. So, for predicting that profit of a company  for a particular period we need to train machine learning model with a dataset that contains historical data about the profit generated by the company.  The dataset that I am using for the task of profit prediction includes data about the R&amp;D spend, administration cost, Marketing spends, State of operation, and the historical profit generated by 50 start-ups.  summary - we can predict the profit of a company for a particular period by machine learning algorithm(linear regression). Such task can help a company to set a target that can be achieved.
